## Code Book for the data in average_mean_std_data.txt

This data contains 180 observations and 68 columns. The first coloumn indicates which subject (1-30) that measurements belongs to. Likewise, the second column indicates the type of activity (1-6). Please note that one can use the mapping below for this second column: 

1: WALKING
2: WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3: WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4: SITTING
5: STANDING
6: LAYING

The remaning 66 columns indicate the "average" of the measurement types for every subject and activity combination (30*6=180 rows/combinations)

The column names are self-explanatory, and basically correspond to either time domain or frequency domain measurements of the mean and standard deviation of the original recordings.
